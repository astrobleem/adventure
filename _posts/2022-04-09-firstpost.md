This first post is simply the results of setting up the GitHub Pages environment, and a few short steps documenting the steps 
I took to get Jupyter Notebook working on my system.

First I needed to create the blog, for that I am going to use GitHub's pages.
This is my first post.

I will be to setup the environment. 

Assuming that Python and Visual Studio code are already installed.

We install Jupyter Lab
```
pip install jupyterlab
```

We will use Juypter notebook classic
```
pip install notebook

I open the web browser, and click new Python
