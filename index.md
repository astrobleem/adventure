Hi, I'm Chad!

I am going to document my progress with machine learning using Python.

First I needed to create the blog, for that I am going to use GitHub's pages.
This is my first post.

I will be to setup the environment. 

Assuming that Python and Visual Studio code are already installed.

We install Jupyter Lab
```
pip install jupyterlab
```

We will use Juypter notebook classic
```
pip install notebook
```

I open the web browser, and click new Python

I now have a Jupyter Notebook

Next post we will install the needed dependencies.



Anaconda, 
2.) The second steps will be retreive our dataset
