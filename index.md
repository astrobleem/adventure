#Hi, I'm Chad!


I am going to document my progress with machine learning using Python.

Me: "Alexa, define Machine Learning"

Machine Learning is a field of study concerned with the design and study of algorithms that are used by computers to learn.

An example application of this could be a system that is able to improve from experience without being explicitly programmed to do so.

Artificial intelligence, broadly defined is the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behaviors.

Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence. 

Machine Learning systems can use data to explain what happened.

Machine Learning systems can use data to predict what may happen in the future.

Machine Learning systems can use data to prescribe, or make suggestive actions.

There are three subcategories of machine learning.

Supervised models, trained on labeled datasets become more accurate over time.

Unsupervised models, looking for patterns in unlabeled data, identifying trends not explicitly being searched for.

Reinforcement models through trial and error establish the best course of action utilizing a reward system, helping it to understand when it has made the right decisions.
